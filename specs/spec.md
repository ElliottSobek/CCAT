Two actions directions on the main menu:
1. Registered Nurses
2. Management

## Nurse
Nurses will have two buttons:

* An “About” section that includes the following:

    * About: The Critical Care Audit Tool (CCAT) is an evidenced-based, self-educating audit tool for Registered Nurses of the ICU and CCU units at the Grey Nuns Hospital to increase their knowledge in documentation while increasing their patient care competencies, care planning, and professional practice. 

    * Aim: To meet the needs of high acuity patients, accreditation standards, best practice standards, and continuing competency requirements, all while meeting the greater goal of improving quality of care and subsequently, patient safety.

* Has “Complete the Audit” button that leads to the audit form that can be submitted at the end.

## Management
Management has one following button (i.e. “For Management” > “Analyze the Results”)

1. Analyze the results

    * This would be a collection of all the audit results as well as an easy display of data analysis; it would be preferred if the user would have to enter a passcode to ensure confidentiality and sole management usage

    * This can be in the form of charts, etc. with percentages of yes/no/not applicable  answers from each question

    * Display how many audits have been submitted 

    * Have the ability to review each audit individually

    * View the final percentage scores of the audits with a cumulative overall percentage score (e.g. one audit had an overall score of 85%; what is the cumulative score for all audits submitted?)
