# CCAT

CCAT is an auditting tool for nurses at a local hospital.

# Build
The code is runnable from Eclipse or Netbeans. We are using the JavaFX framework. Latest JDK and JRE versions are recomended.

Because we are using file i/o and file logging for this project we will need to include a build file later on to create an 
executable jar.  This will most likely be done using Maven or Gradle, however, we are open to suggestions.

# Purpose

The purpose of this app is to help Nurses at a local hospital complete their daily audits more efficiently.  The old method of
using pen and paper has become outdated and unresourceful, hence, this app aims to transistion the saved documents into a digital
format.
