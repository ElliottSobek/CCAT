# Critical Care Audit Tool (CCAT)

## What is CCAT

CCAT is an auditing tool for nurses or other certified staff.

## Purpose

CCAT will help Nurses or other certified staff complete their daily audits more efficiently. The use of pen and paper to perform daily audits has become slow, inconsistent, and generally outdated. CCAT aims to solve the aforementioned problems by introducing a consistent structure and persistent records of past audits.

### Java IDE
	
The recommended Java IDE's you can use are NetBeans, Eclipse, and IntelliJ.
	
[NetBeans](https://netbeans.org/ "NetBeans"), [Eclipse](https://eclipse.org/ "Eclipse"), [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/ "IntelliJ")

The code is runnable inside Netbeans, Eclipse and IntelliJ. We are using the JavaFX framework for the UI. The latest JDK and JRE versions are recommended.
