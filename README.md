# CCAT (Critical Care Audit Tool)

## What is CCAT

CCAT is an auditing tool for nurses or other certified staff.

## Purpose

CCAT will help Nurses or other certified staff complete their daily audits more efficiently. The use of pen and paper to perform daily audits has become slow, inconsistent, and generally outdated. CCAT aims to solve the aforementioned problems by introducing a consistent structure and persistent records of past audits.
